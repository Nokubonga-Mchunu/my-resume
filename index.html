        <h3><li>Experiential Training - Volkswagen (Gqeberha)</li></h3>
        <p>During my work experience at the Volkswagen Plant in Kariega (Gqeberha, South 
            Africa) I collaborated with a team of IT students from different parts of South Africa, 
            to develop a concept platform, which significantly enhanced my interpersonal skills. 
            Working in a team environment taught me the importance of collaboration, creativity 
            as well as effective problem-solving. This experience also deepened my 
            understanding of workplace dynamics and professional practices within the IT 
            industry. Communication was key to our success, and I developed strong skills in 
            articulating ideas, providing feedback, and active listening. This experience not only 
            solidified my passion for technology, but it also prepared me to contribute 
            meaningfully to future projects and teams.</p>
